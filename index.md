# About Me

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Purdue University under the guidance of [Prof. Antonio Bianchi](https://antoniobianchi.me/). I completed my Master of Science in Computer Science at Binghamton University, SUNY, where I was recognized as a Distinguished Graduate Student. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Information Security from Renmin University of China. My research focuses on program analysis, binary analysis, and reverse engineering, with a particular emphasis on developing innovative techniques for verifying patch safety and enhancing vulnerability management processes.
